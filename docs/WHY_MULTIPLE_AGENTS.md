# Why Businesses Need Multiple AI Agents

## TL;DR
One agent can't handle everything. Businesses need specialized agents for different purposes, phone lines, and use cases.

  - Knows: Downtown menu, staff names, parking info

- **Agent 2 - Suburb Location**
  - "We're at 456 Oak Ave, open until 9 PM"
  - Knows: Family menu, kid-friendly options

- **Agent 3 - Beach Location**
  - "We're on the boardwalk, open until 11 PM"

## Common Questions

### Q: Can't I just use one agent for everything?
**A:** You could, but it gets confusing. Example:
- Same agent answers sales line AND support line
- Has to ask: "Which location are you calling about?"
- Can't specialize script for purpose
- Analytics mixed together (can't track sales vs support performance)

### Q: What if I only have one location?
**A:** You might still want multiple agents:
1. Sales inquiries agent
2. Appointment booking agent
3. Customer support agent

### Q: Can agents transfer calls?
**A:** Yes! But specialized agents reduce transfers:
- Caller reaches right agent immediately
- Faster resolution
- Better customer experience

### Q: Can I change agent scripts easily?
**A:** Yes! Each agent has its own:
- Script
- Voice
- Personality
- Knowledge base
